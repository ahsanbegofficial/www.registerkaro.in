                <p className='text-justify'>Before the enactment of the Companies Act of 2013, the formation of a company in {cityName} necessitated at least two individuals. However, with the advent of this legislation, thereâ€™s a notable shift towards promoting One Person Companies (OPCs). The Companies Act of 2013 specifically facilitates the creation and operation of OPCs in {cityName}, allowing a single individual to spearhead such entities. While traditional private companies mandate a minimum of two directors and two members, a One Person Company is a departure from this norm, as it can be formed by a single person. The legal framework supporting OPCs in {cityName} is outlined in Section 262 of the Companies Act of 2013. The OPC Registration process requires the representation of the entire company by a lone director and a single member. Noteworthy is the streamlined compliance structure associated with OPCs, which imposes fewer responsibilities compared to traditional private companies. This legal provision offers a simplified avenue for individuals looking to establish and operate companies independently in {cityName}.</p>
